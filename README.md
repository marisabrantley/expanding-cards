# Expanding Cards Project
This expanding cards project features five different images of beaches in my area. When clicked, an image card expands while the other cards remain inactive.

## Objective
Style five cards each with background images and headings. Use Flexbox to align the cards, JavaScript event listeners to change the cards' classes to active when clicked, and CSS transitions to smoothly expand the cards.
